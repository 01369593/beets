The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all. It
catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes using
the [MusicBrainz][] database. Then it provides a bouquet of tools for
manipulating and accessing your music.

Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can
imagine for your music collection. Via [plugins][], beets becomes a panacea:

[plugins]: http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/

* Find, download, and embed album art from multiple sources.
* Fetch lyrics for all your songs from databases on the Web.
* Guess genres based on Last.fm tags.
* Clean up crufty tags left behind by other, less-awesome tools.
* Automatically build ``smart playlists'' based on queries over your library
  database.
* Transcode music for your mobile device.
* Manage your [MusicBrainz music collection][coll].
* Analyze music files' metadata from the command line.
* Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in
  any browser that supports [HTML5 audio][].
* ...and [lots more][plugins].

If beets doesn't do what you want yet, [writing your own plugin][writing] is
shockingly simple if you know a little Python.
